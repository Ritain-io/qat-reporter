# QAT::Reporter

- Welcome to the QAT Reporter gem!

## Table of contents 
- This gem have functionalities such as:
    - Status from test executions;
    - Time measurements.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'qat-reporter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install qat-reporter
    
# Usage
```ruby
require 'qat/reporter'
```

## Status from test executions:
In order to check status from test executions it is necessary to run the following task:
```ruby
rake test:run 
```
With the cucumber options:
```bash
--format QAT::Reporter::Formatter::ReqCoverage --out public/requirement_coverage.json
```
This will create a file ```requirement_coverage.json``` in the ```public/``` folder.

## Time measurements:
In order to take time measurements first it is necessary to create the following folder structure:
```
project   
└───config
│   └───common
│       └───qat
|           └───reporter
|                   | times.yml
```

The file times.yml contains the time measurements tag with name description and its user defined limits:
```bash
test_measure:
  name: This is a test measure
  sla_warn: 10
  sla_error: 15
```
To start measuring an interaction:
```ruby
QAT::Reporter::Times.start(:test_measure)
```

To stop measuring an interaction:
```ruby
QAT::Reporter::Times.stop(:test_measure)
```

Or it can measure a block of code:
```ruby
QAT::Reporter::Times.measure(:test_measure) do
    code
    ...
    ...
  end
```

In the end of each test a time report is generated:

```ruby
Time Report:
| Interaction             | Start                    | End                      | Duration |
| ------------------------| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------- |
| This is a test measure  | 2019-08-06  5:30:50+0100 | 2019-08-06  5:31:59+0100 | 01m 08s  |
```

Also, it is possible to generate a Json file with the cucumber options:
```bash
--format QAT::Reporter::Formatter::TimeMeasurements --out public/times.json
```
This will create a file ```times.json``` in the ```public/``` folder with the following structure:
```bash

    "feature": "Time measure",
    "tags": [
      "@feature",

              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
