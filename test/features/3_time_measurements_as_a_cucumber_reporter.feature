Feature: Feature #3 Time Measurements Report
  As a user,
  In order to see my test's interactions times,
  I want to have a test interactions' time report

  @test#29
  Scenario: Take a time measurement
    Given I copy the directory named "../../resources/qat_project_time_measures" to "project"
    And I cd to "project"
    And I set the environment variables to:
      | variable        | value                                                             |

      | CUCUMBER_OPTS   | --format QAT::Formatter::TimeMeasurements --out public/times.json |
    When I run `rake test:run`
    Then the exit status should be 0
    And a file named "public/times.json" should exist
    And a file named "public/times.json" should match:
